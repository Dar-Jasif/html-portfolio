<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Dar Jasif, a second-year computer science student. I attended school in my hometown. I've always been enticed
  by technology and problem solving, which lured me into the realm of coding and software development. I appreciate
  working with my classmates to solve complex problems and invent solutions.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I enjoy learning new technologies, competing in coding challenges, and working on personal
  projects. I'm particularly interested in artificial intelligence and am intrigued about its potential to transform
  numerous industries.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, my goal is to capitalize on my abilities to contribute to worthwhile technology solutions whilst 
acquiring knowledge in the field of computer science. I'm anticipating looking forward to interacting with professionals
and peers that share a fascination with technology, as well as exploring prospective internships and collaborative 
opportunities.</p>
